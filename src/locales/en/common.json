    "Emyle": "Trilha was an incredible experience. If it weren't for the project, I would hardly have come into contact with so many important programming topics in my first semester. It not only provided me with a technical foundation, but also helped me develop skills such as teamwork and project management, especially during the hackathon, preparing me for real professional life.",
    "Miguel": "Trilha was of paramount importance for my introduction to the computer science course which, until then, was predominantly theoretical. The weekly classes and the hackathon at the end of the period transformed my view of programming by making me put into practice all the theory learned in class. I was very happy and grateful to have participated, so I recommend it to everyone who is starting the course!",
    "LuisAranha": "Trilha was an experience that provided me with a lot of learning and connection with important people in the field, explaining everything from the basics of what programming is and what a programming language is, especially Python, to how to produce a group project with extremely competent people who walked the path with me. I believe it was of great importance to me, since I started the Computer Science course with almost zero knowledge of the area, and it helped me fill this void!",
    "Marcus": "Here, I had great experiences with things I never thought I would have. I was able to learn from people who inspire me and, from beginning to end, I had enormous satisfaction in participating in this journey.",
    "Clara": "The experience that Trilha provided was simply unique. The project helped me grow both as a student and as a person, teaching me to be more focused and to work better in teams. More than that, meeting incredible people and hearing inspiring stories completely changed the way I see the field. I am very grateful to everyone involved, because Trilha has profoundly marked my life, both personally and academically.",
    "Kruta": "The Trilha program was a fundamental pillar for my education at the beginning of my undergraduate studies. In it, I had the opportunity to meet new people, build valuable friendships and acquire a lot of knowledge, both in the technical part and in teamwork and group interaction.",
    "Luigi": "Trilha helped me build a solid foundation and forge a learning path that covers the main concepts needed to enter a first real project. Through it, I developed practical and theoretical skills that were fundamental to my journey, preparing me for challenges like those I currently face at Moises. This experience not only reinforced my confidence, but also opened doors to more complex projects, where I can apply the knowledge received and impact the world.",
    "NicolasKleiton": "Participating in Trilha was an incredible experience for me, especially because I had just entered university, didn't know anyone, and during that time, I was able to meet amazing people. Trilha was essential for putting what we learned into practice, especially during the hackathon. I am very grateful to Trilha for everything. I am sure that this experience was not only important for me but also for everyone who had the chance to participate.",
    "Bea": "Experiencing Trilha was a milestone at the beginning of my journey in Computer Science. The project not only introduced me to the fundamentals of programming, but also gave me the confidence to explore the field with more security. The practical experience and team learning were transformative, showing the importance of collaborating and growing with other people. Trilha was a special part of this beginning, and I am very grateful to have been part of this journey.",
    "DaviGurgel": "Trilha was essential for my beginning of the course and provided me with a very solid foundation of what I will need for good training as a student and professional. The experience was indispensable for me, as I entered the course with little programming background and I believe that Trilha made me reach a level that I might have taken several more months to reach without mentoring. Additionally, during this project I met incredible people, with whom I want to stay in touch for the rest of my life. That's why I'm very grateful to have participated in the first edition of Trilha.",
    "Artur": "Trilha was essential to help me build a solid foundation in the basic concepts of programming and to follow a structured learning path in the various possible areas of the field, covering the main concepts necessary to enter real projects. During this journey, I developed practical and theoretical skills that were of paramount importance to my evolution. Having experiences with recognized professionals in the market and with former students was, for me, the most enriching part of the project. I am extremely happy to have had this unique opportunity!",
    "VitorReis": "Trilha was an incredible experience for me, in which I learned a lot in the field of programming, from the basics to more advanced concepts, and had my first experience in teamwork during the hackathon. In addition, I was able to meet incredible people, to whom I am extremely grateful for making my Fridays happier during Trilha.",
    "RafaelTorres": "Trilha was a transformative experience for me. The project not only helped me build a solid foundation, but also provided contact with very important subjects that I would hardly have known otherwise. Participating in Trilha at the beginning of the course was certainly one of the best decisions I made, I am very grateful to have participated."
